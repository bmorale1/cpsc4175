1. software wasn't being finished on time, the quality was relatively low, budgets were not being met, and were riddled with flaws
2. the Software development life cycle deals with the earlier stages of software, specifically the planning, creation, testing and implementation of the software. The life cycle on the other hand, deals with the larger picture. Namely, what the software will go through its entire life, from creation, implementation, version updates, and inevitably its death. 
3. Perfective Maintenance - a company hires a web designer, and after the website launches, the customer decides they need to add an additional tab for customer service.
Adaptive Maintenance- Google china has certain web searches restricted due to Government regulations
4. Hardware is physical , and will break down due to the natural processes of existence. Software will be continuously improved and updated until it becomes near flawless. 
5. there is an inverse  relationship between the number of flaws found within a piece of software(Prior to and after implementation) and how costly it is to repair them.
6. The process of developing software is very fluid, and phases tend to only happen when needed.
7. Structured programming is still an important part of object oriented programming because it's use of loops, and block structures is very commonplace in most programs. This ubiquitous quality makes it hard not to use.
8. It is more important to interact with the client. the client is responsible for ensuring the software is what they needed for their users, and will take direct input from their users to pass on to the developers.
9. I would help others in their pursuit of computing knowledge by collaborating, assisting, or hearing what they have to say
10. Personally, I have never read much computer science related literature in my time, so this was quite the interesting read. I thought that the proposed ideas for bug detection seem like they would be inefficient are very brilliant ideas. I also like the parallels the concepts drew to real life objects. The cathedral, where followers gather together for their common religion. The code being the cathedral that is released with each new release, and the people being the followers, gathering together for their common goal at one place. Then the bazaar, where people come and go at their leisure to see what is new in the market. The code in this case being the market, the developers the store owners, and the people being the people. As the Developers add more code, the people come in and out to check on what's new, and help where they see bugs. One being a continuous process of bug control, the other done in checkpoints of versions.
