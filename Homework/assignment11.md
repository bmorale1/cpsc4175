1. Step-wise refinement is just a term used to describe how to focus on issues. It says that you should look at the larger parts first, and then let the details fall into place based on how you tackled the larger part. 
2. The most obvious difference is the concept. Top-down step-wise refinement paradigm focuses on the bigger picture first, and then focusing on the individual details and specifics later. OOD focuses more on objects, and their properties, as well as constructing and testing them earlier on. 
3. I have mixed feelings on the article. I believe it is Highly important to understand a language's ins and outs in order to have a good mastery over that. I believe the author was mildly dismissive of this, and cannot agree with that. However I do agree with that the author on the grounds that there does need to be greater focus on methods of design. That aside I thought the demonstration on stepwise refinement to be interesting, yet a little hard to keep up with. It is always reassuring to see mathematical calculations to now that they are knowledgeable, but I need a TLDR version so I can keep up easier with what is being done. 
4. A Company researches outsourcing companies versus local ones in order to determine which option will be the most beneficial to the company. 
5. Running into this issue means that the issue of Separation of Concerns was not appropriately addressed. This can be solved by moving object B into a separate part of the program that addresses its individual use along with its respective methods, and just recreating the method that object A is trying to use in its respective focus.
