1. Java is widely used across many platforms, but in mobile devices only is used by the android platform. Swift on the other hand was developed solely for the use in apple products.
2.  what not to do:  do not use vague variable names, this makes it hard to rewrite code, and causes other developers to struggle to understand your code. do not use bad documentation, leave comments where necessary to help others understand what your code is doing. 
3. could not find
4. In my robotics class I tend to need a very similar move function implemented across several robots. 
5.  Stubs are dummy pieces of code used to mimic actual output, and Drivers are the ones which are calling programs. I used stubs when developing a game in swift to help develop a combat system. 
6.  easy to catch errors made at the top of the program, and test cases are reusable, however it takes longer to see fully functional systems due to the presence of stubs, and lack of lower level modules.
7.  lower level modules are implemented first, so the higher level ones that call on them are able to show higher functionality,and it is easier to test due to lack of stubs. However, it may take longer to show full functionality.
8.  Sandwich testing is a type of test that is used it two parts: top-down, and bottom-up. with this definition, DSL will promote this well as it uses a high and low level language, encouraging the use of top-down and bottom up testing to individually test the parts.
9.   SQA group is more concerned with the bigger picture, they review software standards, and process description for compliance with organizational policy.
10.   Dijkstra laments on the harmful nature of the Go-To statement, and the observations he thinks of to counter them. The Go To statement caused a general decline in the quality of the programs that were created at the time. Given the issues no longer plague our coding society now, but the very generic XYZ statements created a lack of creativity and logical prowess in the community.
