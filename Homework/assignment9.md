1. I would argue to a degree theses both go hand and hand. However, I do think that requirements are constantly changing, and so that will easily disrupt the linear flow of the software development process. 
2. I think it means that it is a repetitive process but not one that is added on to. Like a waterfall, It continues to flow, but it does not come back around.
3. I use to compete in public speaking competitions. I wrote all my speeches by first focusing on my most important point in the speech, and then gathering more less important, but still strong supporting points. I have not won every single contest I have ever gone into but I have gotten two second place prizes, and a third place prize.
4. The Requirements of a project are prone to changing at any time, whether it be from the Client or developer. There may have been an unforeseen need that was not noticed until the testing phase, or there was a reworking of the requirements during implementation, or any phase for that matter. Testing realistically should not occur until the second iteration as testing half baked code will not give you a strong indication of where your software is in development.
5. Iterative and incremental development is a process for developing software based on producing deliverables. In incremental development, different parts of the software are made at different points, and are integrated based on their completion. In iterative development, teams revisit parts of the code in order to revise them. User feedback is consulted to modify the targets for successive deliverables.
6. I would agree, while documentation seems to be a rather annoying part, it is important to keep everything organized and have updates recorded.
7. I would say the Code and fix life cycle Model. It most closely reflects my style of development which is to just go back and fix consistently. It also has the lowest amount of post-delivery maintenance to do, as it should be mostly complete.
8. Just looking at these equations was mind-boggling. I have always wondered how abstract the logical operations behind equations were. It seems very strange that the mathematical operations are so short yet complex. It truly takes a high mental acuity to be able to think of these
