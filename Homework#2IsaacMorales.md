1. The first step in developing a piece of software is to compile a list of its requirements(both functional and non-functional)
2. The client may not actually know what it is they need for the software, or may not be able to articulate it properly. the software may need some additional things that the client did not mention. For example, the client needs a software that will be able to keep up with their employees hours, but never mentions an administrative view or an approval system.
3. a software engineer just generally develops software, they do not specify in one aspect of it.
4. interviewing, questionnaire, and direct observation. Interviewing seems like it would be the most effective method to me. The only way it could be ineffective is if you were to interview an employee who did not know what was needed. questionnaires could easily go wrong if the receivers of it do not answer fully. Direct observations could be bad if you do not spend adequate time observing the employees, or if you do not observe diligently.
5. The requirements of a software could be dynamic as in they are constantly changing. what was sufficient for it a year ago may not work for it anymore due to company growth, fluxing of business, or change of leadership.
6. Functional requirements are what a software will need for base functionality, while non-functional requirements are the additional pieces, such as the aesthetics, the response time, or extra non-necessary functions. I do think that there can be requirements that the software just does not need in that moment, but I do not think that means it is necessarily non-functional.
7. Top-down analysis is where you begin the analysis with the "big picture", and then start narrowing into the finer details. In the study it seems as though they are examining what the customers of the clients need to do at their business, and the way the process is handled.
8. Prototyping is harmful because of the image it gives their work. A client probably does not have an appreciation for the work put into the software, and only sees something that is not what they asked for. This can hurt the developers reputation. 
9. I believe that team one is doing the better job. Because they make infrequent changes means that they meet together , and make very deliberate decisions on what the software does and does not require. 
10. Because of bad communication during the requirements gathering phase of the software development.
